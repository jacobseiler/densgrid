List of TODOs
=============

Move the grid reading/writing functions into their own file (grid_io.c for example).
Rework the grid_io functions to have different ones for reading int/float/doubles.
Add compile options for float/double for densgrid/sum_densgrid and int/float/double for normalize_grid.
